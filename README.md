# Image-Recognition
 This repository contains a deep learning model trained on the MNIST dataset for recognizing handwritten digits (0-9). The model, implemented using TensorFlow/Keras, achieves high accuracy on the validation dataset and is suitable for use in digit recognition applications.
 
A neural network model on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. Here's a summary based on your code and the output you shared:

1. **Model Architecture**: You created a Sequential model with two dense layers:
   - Flatten layer to convert each 28x28 image into a 1D array.
   - Dense layer with 512 units and ReLU activation.
   - Final Dense layer with 10 units (for 10 classes in MNIST) and softmax activation.

2. **Training**: You compiled the model with RMSprop optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, and monitored accuracy as a metric. The model was trained for 50 epochs using the `fit()` function.

3. **Performance**: The model achieved high training accuracy (~99.77%) but the validation accuracy plateaued around 97.8% after some epochs, indicating possible overfitting.

4. **Evaluation**: You evaluated the model's performance on the test set and monitored both loss and accuracy metrics over epochs using `history.history`.

5. **Conclusion**: Your model shows strong performance on the training set but slightly lower performance on the validation and test sets, suggesting that regularization techniques or adjustments to the model architecture could be beneficial to improve generalization.

If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with interpreting the results or modifying your model, feel free to ask!
